## Automatic provisioning
On installation our agent creates an agent.conf file containing a UID. This UID is used to identify the server on our platform. When creating an image it is important to remove the agent.conf file. If you donâ€™t the agent will push metrics for the previous server and not add a new one. You can find the file in `/opt/coscale/agent/etc` on Linux or `C:/Program Files (x86)/CoScale/Agent/` on Windows.


## [Pushing server status to CoScale on boot and shutdown]({{ site.baseurl }}/agent/cloud/server-status)
Enable or disable a server in our platform when it is booted or shut down.
