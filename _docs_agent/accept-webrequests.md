CoScale automatically accepts web requests once a threshold of 1,000 requests within a time frame of 10 minutes is reached. If those conditions are not met, we will process the suggestions after 24 hours. However, you can manually accept requests from your app, before that threshold is reached.

1. Navigate to your <a href="http://app.coscale.com" db-href="/metrics/requests/" class="js-dashboard-link">web requests</a> page. This page is available in the navigation menu: Metrics > Web.

2. Click on the orange hamburger icons. Web requests can be available either on top level or on child level.

3. You can validate all the suggestions or you can select just a subset.
