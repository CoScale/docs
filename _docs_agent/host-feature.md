If the CoScale agent is installed as a Container, you can now gather data from services running on the host, without creating and installing another agent as a package.

## Steps

* Click on the "Add image" button.

* In the "Repository" filed, write HOST (all caps).

<img alt="HOST feature" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/gfx/agent/extra/host-feature.png" style="img-responsive"/>

* Add the plugins for the services you want to monitor and configure them, by following the instructions on the screen.
