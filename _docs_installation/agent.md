## Updating the Agent

## Security

* All communication goes through a secured SSL connection.
* Agents communicate with unique token that can be revoked by CoScale when necessary.
* Our agent only needs a connection to the outside, so no port forwarding.
* All plugins are signed and checked by agent before deploying.
* When requested the agent auto update procedure can be disabled.
