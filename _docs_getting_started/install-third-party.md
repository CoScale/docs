title: Configuring Third party resources
---

CoScale integrates with third party resources, like Google Analytics, to provide valuable insights into external metrics of your application. We integrate with [many different services]({{ site.baseurl }}/getting-started/third-party.html), so you can get an overview of your entire application without having to check multiple tools. You can find a list of all our active integrations by selecting `Datasources` > `Third party` in our sidebar.

To install, click the plugin you would like to activate and follow the instructions. Our service will automatically start gather data. You can enable as many plugins as you like.

## Onto the last Step
We have now installed and enabled the most important datasources of our platform. The next step will provide you with information to optionally push custom metrics, integrate events and monitoring hidden jobs. Click the button below to get started.
