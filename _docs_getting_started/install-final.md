## [Events / Job monitoring]({{ site.baseurl }}/installation/events/index)
Annotate your metrics to get a more complete view of your application. Push marketing campaigns, software deploys, infrastructure upgrades, .. and get more insight in the effects of actions.

## [Custom metrics]({{ site.baseurl }}/installation/custom-metrics/index/)
Monitor application specific metrics that matter to your stack.
