Integrating CoScale with your application is easy and straightforward process. This manual will guide you through installing the CoScale platform into your environment and help setup some important third party resources. If you have questions or problems, please don't hesitate to contact our support, as we will gladly help you. You can use the button in the sidebar to open support chat.

## Platform support

Before we get started, let's take a look at our supported [platforms]({{ site.baseurl }}/getting-started/platforms.html) and [technologies]({{ site.baseurl }}/getting-started/technologies.html). They provide an overview of possible integrations and metrics you will get out of our system. You don't have to integrate with everything from the start, but for a complete view of your application we do advice it.
