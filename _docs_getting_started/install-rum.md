title: Install Real User Monitoring
---

The CoScale Real User Monitoring service or RUM is a javascript snippet that provides insight into the performance on the user's device. It tells you what is happening on your website after a webpage has left your infrastructure.

To install we need to add the javascript snippet just before the `</head>` tag on your website. It is best to add it the general template, so you can get a complete oversight of your application.

    To find our snippet, go to 'Metrics' > 'Real user monitoring' in our sidebar.
</p>

You can now follow the instructions on the screen, it will direct you to the RUM component installation page containing the instructions to integrate with your website. After installing the script our service should detect incoming traffic within minutes, but it does depend on the amount of traffic the website receives.
