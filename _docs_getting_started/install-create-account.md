## Activating your account
By now you should have received an invitation e-mail. (<a href="http://www.coscale.com/free-trial" target="_blank">Click here if you haven't.</a>) The e-mail contains a link to activate your account. Press the link or copy paste it into in your preferred browser to get started with the activation. You should see a login page similar to the screenshot below.

<p class="text-center"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/gfx/getting-started/install-create-account/login.png" alt="CoScale login page" /></p>

On this page you have to pick a password and press the ‘Activate your account’ button.

{% include alert.html type="warning" text="For security reasons, your password must be 8 characters or longer, have at least 1 number, 1 lower case letter and 1 upper case letter." %}

After activating your account, you will be taken to our welcome message.
