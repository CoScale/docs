Dashboards can be shared with all users, specific users, public url or private. Depending on the setting different user have access to the dashboard. 

* **All users**

    Everyone with an account to your application can access the dashboard.

* **Private**

    Only the current logged in user can access the dashboard.

* **Public**

    After setting the permission to public and saving, you will receive an url from the CoScale system. You can then share this url with other users outside of CoScale. This means that they won't need to login to be able to access the information available on the dashboard.

* **Specific users**

    Select a group of users that can access the dashboard. These users should have an account on your application.
