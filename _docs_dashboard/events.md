## Creating a category
Before we can add events to the dashboard we need to make sure we have a category to add them to. You can create an event category by going to the event page in the sidebar (Screenshot below). After you click the `Add category` button to create a category. You give it a name, description, and if you wish an icon. It is also possible to [add attributes to categories]({{ site.baseurl }}/events/custom-attributes/).

<div class="row">

    <div class="col-md-4">
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl}}/gfx/dashboard/events/event_menu.png" alt="Event sidebar element" class="img-responsive" />
    </div>

    <div class="col-md-8">
        <h2>Adding events</h2>

        <h3>Through sidebar</h3>
        Go to the event page in the sidebar (Screenshot below). When you hover over a category a button will appear called `Add event`. Click the button to add an event to this category.

        <h3>On graph</h3>
        You can also add events to graphs by clicking on a line in the graph, the detail about the line will pup-up. In the view you can click the `Add event` button.
