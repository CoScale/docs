## Description
CoScale command wrappers or cron wrappers are scripts that automatically send event data to the CoScale monitoring service. It tracks runtime and exit code of your command and sends this information to CoScale. This allows you to visualize the performance and health of your automated jobs.

We also provide a [cron plugin]({{ site.baseurl }}/agent/plugins/cron/) as a more generic way of putting your cron jobs into CoScale.
