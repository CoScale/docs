## [Chef]({{ site.baseurl }}/events/automation/chef)

You can integrate CoScale into Chef so that you can push events to CoScale whenever you make a configuration change. We offer a Chef module to automatically report new deployments. [More details here]({{ site.baseurl }}/events/automation/chef)

## [Puppet]({{ site.baseurl }}/events/automation/puppet)

Puppet integration is also available with CoScale. Our integration will allow you to push events to CoScale whenever you make a configuration change. [More details here]({{ site.baseurl }}/events/automation/puppet)

## [Salt]({{ site.baseurl }}/events/automation/salt)

Internally we use Salt to manage our infrastructure, so it is safe to say that we also support integration with Salt. Our integration will allow you to push events to CoScale whenever you make a configuration change. [More details here]({{ site.baseurl }}/events/automation/salt)
