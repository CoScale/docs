Before you can start creating alerts we must create a notification scheme. You will attach alerts to certain notification scheme. A notification scheme is just a group of contacts that will be contacted whenever one of the alerts withing the notification scheme triggers.


<ol>
    <li>
        Go to the alerts manage page and click the create notification scheme button.

        <p>
            <img alt="Add notification scheme buttons screenshot" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/gfx/alerting/notificationScheme/createScheme.png"/>
        </p>

    </li>

    <li>
        You will see the notification scheme dialog appear with the form inside.

        <p>The most important things here is that you must give the scheme a name, and you must also add at least one contact.</p>

        <p>The rest of the form is not required but might be beneficial for your situation so it is worth considering also filling backup and escalation contacts.</p>

        <p>
            <img alt="Add contact screenshot" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/gfx/alerting/notificationScheme/schemeDialog.png"/>
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>
            Once you clicked the add contact button you will see a contact block appear. In this block you can select the contact method and fill in the value for each method.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can add as many contacts as you wish.
        </p>

        <p>
            <img alt="Contact information screenshot" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/gfx/alerting/notificationScheme/addingContact.png"/>
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        Once you are done filling in the form click save and you will see a notification scheme block appear on the page.
