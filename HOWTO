### Support link
By adding a `js-support` class to a link it will try to open intercom first, before opening the e-mail client.

Ex: `<a href="mailto:info@coscale.com" class="js-support">contact us</a>`


### Dashboard links

When APP_ID cookie is set links with js-dashboard-link will be replaced with an url to the page in href.
When no APP_ID is available these links will be disabled.

Ex: `<a href="http://app.coscale.com" db-href="/alerts/manage/" class="js-dashboard-link">`Alerts > Manage`</a>`
